"YOU'D BETTER GET YOURSELF TOGETHER, BABY"
(Gibbs/Hurley)

The stars and moon collide up in the sky tonight
And you are looking really really high tonight

Oh I can see
Just what you're trying to be
You'd better get yourself together, baby

Like an autumn leave that's spinning round and round
I wonder will you shatter when you hit the ground

Oh can't you see
You're falling rapidly
You'd better get yourself together
Get yourself together
You'd better get yourself together, baby

The stars and moon fell from the sky
And now they make your bed
And you've become more than twice the sum
Of everything you've seen, heard and read

Oh can't you see
You're sinking silently
You better get yourself together
Get yourself together
Get yourself together, baby

You'd better get yourself together, baby
